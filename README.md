# 🚆 Railway Reservation System (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Railway Reservation System** using **MySQL**.  
It simulates how a real-world railway booking database works by managing trains,
passengers, tickets, seat allocation, and payments.

The system demonstrates core **Relational Database** concepts and SQL operations.
